# Text Summarizer

Small Python project that summarizes text using Hugging Face Transformers.

Files:
- `tempCodeRunnerFile.py` - CLI script that reads pasted text and prints a short summary.

Requirements:
- See `requirements.txt` for Python dependencies.

Usage:
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the script: `python tempCodeRunnerFile.py` and paste your article, end input with Ctrl+Z then Enter on Windows.

Notes:
- The script uses `sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6` and may download model weights on first run.
